          <h3>Yahtzee</h3>
          <p>
            The first project was a group assignment to build a web based Yahtzee game. We started of with a HTML table
            filled with
            inputs (yay, fun... especially before learing how to use Emmet...) and applied styling with CSS. After
            learning about how to manipulate the DOM with JS we set up event listeners and built a basic summing
            function. Then, after our lecture in objected oriented programming we started to transfer our more
            straight-forward code to a class-based version.
            A real challenge if you've never dealt with OOP before.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learned a lot from my team, practical code related things as well as social.<br>
            For example, one team member helped me grasp the usage of the this.-keyword in JS.
            The assignment also solidified a basic understanding of the relationship between HTML, CSS and JS.

          <h3>Quiz</h3>
          <p>
            The first individual project was to create a quiz game. This time, the assignment required us to get the
            questions from an API, which meant that we had to enter the realm of useful albeit hard
            to grasp concepts like asynchronous code with promises and the async/await keywords. I decided to build the
            quiz in classes from start, which took quite some time because I still hadn't fully wrapped my head around
            all the uses and benefits of coding in classes as opposed to writing function after function.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really struggled to get started with this assignment, mostly because I felt overwhelmed by not knowing how
            to go about stucturing everything. In the end, after getting a hang of it all, the quiz resulted in
            something that I was proud of having achieved, even though it is far from perfect. My class Skill leveled up
            at least 3 levels.

          <h3>Event Manager</h3>
          <p>
            Another group assignment, this time challenging us to design an event handler site by adhering to a visual
            identity provided by another team. We also had to design an admin interface that, by using the
            brower's local storage, simulated a way to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) events, as well as create
            functions for sorting and filtering events. Throughout the assignment we worked according to the Scrum
            framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this assignment I learned a lot about team work in general and more specifically about Scrum. I was a
            Scrum Master for a week. During that time I tried really hard to actively check in with the team to make
            sure everyone was feeling okay with their tasks, our sprint goals and our deadlines.

            My name is Antonio. I live in Stockholm, Sweden.
            I'm a somewhat nerdy problem solver with a passion for learning. I'm currently spendning most of my
            time in front of YouTube tutorials about programming, or on Mozilla Developer Network to check JS, CSS and
            HTML
            references. I love the feeling of constantly being challenged intellectually.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I'm not studying I like creating sounds and soundscapes using synthesizers and drum machines. It's like
            therapy for me, allowing me to cleanse my mind by fully focusing on the sounds and rhythms I'm producing by
            twisting and turning knobs.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also studied Japanese and Mandarin Chinese:
